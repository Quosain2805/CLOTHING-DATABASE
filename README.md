# CLOTHING-DATABASE
It's a Clothing database shopping procedure to print a receipt of selling in Python.

1.	Introduction:

In this Project, we are going to design a database for a clothing store. Which will have all the codes of the articles stored within and will show the user the codes on demand with prices and tell the colors of the articles at once differentiated by the design codes. The user can select any article wanted and a proper billing system will be made including discounts.

2.	Methodology:

      Here is Our Plan and Methodology to Develop the Program.


In this code, The user name will be asked at first, then will be asked that which type of articles the user want to see, the variable in which is stored in will search for the desired dictionary (Total on 4 dictionaries used) and will display all the codes and prices of those desired articles, the user can choose any article desired, which will be added into the cart (List), the user will be asked again if wanted another, if not the loop will end inside the function and last time displaying the sale offer will be asked again if the user wants buy some more if yes, the program will bring us back at the start of the program inside the function, where the user will be asked again about what type of articles the user would like to see (at the end of the second incoming, the user will not be told about the sale again, and the program will go out of the function). And if not, the program will end too after the sale option is denied, then the program will check about the prices if it meets under a specific condition then the discount set will be given accordingly, after that a proper receipt will be displayed including Article names. with prices, total price, discount price, price after discount and final price and a bar code with a receipt number and will be said thanks with the. Name entered in the very beginning of the program.

How it Works Exactly.

*STEPS*:

User Side:
â€¢	User asked to enter the system Name.
â€¢	User asked to about the Article Type.
â€¢	User can choose any article and add it in the cart.
â€¢	User will get a receipt of the items the user Purchased.

Developer Side:
â€¢	Declared variables that are going to be used in Program (string variables for input and results).
â€¢	Can input only any alphabet size as it will be converted into lower characters.
â€¢	According to the demand the desired items will be shown and can be purchased any item within.
â€¢	According to the Total Price the Discounts will be Given Up to been Displayed.
â€¢	We have used lists, Dictionaries, Loops, Condition statements and simple Function in our Project.



3.	Specifications:
As we have a finite knowledge about Python concepts which we studied in this Semester. So, we tried our best applying all that knowledge, and our team experience to get our Project done.

We made code for the Clothing Management which makes the Work-Process easy to use:
â€¢	Dictionaries 
â€¢	Lists
â€¢	Functions
â€¢	Different loops(if, else if, While, For)
â€¢	Color Scheme(Background & Text Color, Font Style)
â€¢	Random Library Imported
â€¢	String Formatting

4.	Conclusion:

In this Project we have learned the basics of Pytho concepts. In which  we have learned that what is Database, and how can we manage it in python efficiently. While using lists, dictionaries our concept was approached. To a whole another level of understanding python and its basic features as thereâ€™s so much, we can do inside it, with Color coding a user-friendly environment was made like GUI, basically using lists, dictionaries, strings, string formatting, functions, made a database easy to work with a whole lot of user friendly     ðŸ˜Š !!!
Hope our effort made a Good Point!
Thank-You.
